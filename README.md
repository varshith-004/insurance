# Insurance Cost Prediction System

This project is a **machine learning-based system** designed to predict insurance costs based on user-provided data. The system preprocesses the data, trains a regression model, and provides cost estimates.

## 📌 Features

- **User Input Handling**: Accepts insurance-related data from users.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms input data for training.
- **Model Training**: Uses a regression-based machine learning model.
- **Cost Prediction**: Provides an estimated insurance cost.
- **User-Friendly Flow**: End-to-end automated process.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning model training)
  - Flask (for web API, if applicable)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-cost-prediction.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd insurance-cost-prediction
3.Install dependencies:
 
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Run the project:
 
python main.py

🏗️ Project Workflow:
1.User provides insurance data (age, BMI, smoking status, etc.).
2.Data preprocessing cleans and prepares the input.
3.Machine learning model is trained using regression techniques.
4.Prediction module estimates the insurance cost.
5.Result is returned to the user.
🖼️ System Architecture

🛠️ How to Use
1.Provide insurance data via input form or API.
2.The system processes and predicts the insurance cost.
3.View the estimated cost as output.
🏆 Future Enhancements
.Implement a deep learning model for better accuracy.
.Add API integration for real-world applications.
.Improve visualization of predictions with graphs.
